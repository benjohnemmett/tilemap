# Tile Map
This is a basic tile map project. It can download tile images from a web server and use them to render a map. Marking single pixel points on the map is also supported. 

# Map Tile Providers
Be sure to follow the policies of the map tile provider. 

## Open Street Map
This has not yet been tested with OSM, though it should work if you follow their policies.
